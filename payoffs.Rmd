library("kableExtra")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

##  Round `r which_round` was randomly chosen to determine payoffs.

* Come get your chocolate or $ if the last 5 digits of your ID are in this list:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kable(come_on_up, booktabs = T, linesep = "") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```

* The best guesser was `r best_guesser$oneid` who was the highest bidder in `r best_guesser$auctions_won` auctions, and their estimate of how many times they were the highest bidder was `r best_guesser$sum_prob_endowed`. Your prize is $5.
